This Qt Project implements a Ray Tracing rendering engine which is paired
with a GUI application to allow live rendering and experiementation with 
render techniques such as shaders or anti-aliasing. The application is
intended to be a learning tool to help those interested in understanding
how the different techniques affect the render results; in addition, the
source code of the project can also be used as a teaching tool, as an 
example implementation of many of common structures we see in graphics 
today. 
 
The project was created as partfil fulfillment of the course requirements
of CSC 305 at the University of Victoria under the instruction of Brian
Wyvill. 

Features:
---------

User Interaction
- users of the application are able to change the following settings through
  the GUI which will directly affect the next render interation:
  	- Number of thread workers for the operation
  	- Resolution of the rendered image


System Architecture and Design
- The ray tracing render process is multi-threaded
